# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction-System

## Project Overview

### Project Description
This project involves analyzing a medical insurance charges dataset to predict insurance costs based on various parameters such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region in the USA. The dataset is cleaned, explored, and used to develop Linear Regression models for predicting insurance charges. Additionally, Ridge regression is applied to refine the performance of the models. The goal is to gain insights into factors influencing insurance charges and create predictive models to assist in pricing and risk assessment within the insurance industry.

### Project Scenario
You have to perform data analytics on a medical insurance charges dataset. This is a filtered and modified version of the Medical Insurance Price Prediction dataset, available under the CC0 1.0 Universal License on the Kaggle website.

### Parameters
The parameters used in the dataset are:

| Parameter       | Description                                       | Data Type |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Age             | Age of the insured. Integer quantity.             | Integer   |
| Gender          | Gender of the insured. This parameter has been mapped to numerical values in the following way: Female (1), Male (2). | Integer   |
| BMI             | Body Mass Index of the insured. Float value quantity. | Float     |
| No_of_Children  | Number of children the insured person has. Integer quantity. | Integer   |
| Smoker          | Whether the insured person is a smoker or not. This parameter has been mapped to numerical values in the following way: Smoker (1), Non-smoker (2). | Integer   |
| Region          | Which region of the USA does the insured belong to. This parameter has been mapped to numerical values in the following way: Northwest (1), Northeast (2), Southwest (3), Southeast (4). | Integer   |
| Charges         | Charges for the insurance in USD. Floating value quantity. | Float     |

### Objectives
In this project, you will:

- Load the data as a pandas dataframe
- Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries
- Run exploratory data analysis and identify the attributes that most affect the charges
- Develop single variable and multi variable Linear Regression models for predicting the charges
- Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models.
